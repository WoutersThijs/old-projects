# old-projects
Repository containing all coding projects (I could find) that I've made before my studies. All these projects are made around 2015, when I was 15 years old. I've learned to code Java with the Spigot API all by myself. The code is not the best and cleanest, but for being 15, it was quite an accomplishment.
